Do not add additional commentary or pre-amble to the response. REPLY ONLY WITH THE RESULT as requested.

You are given the transcript, description, uploader, and channel of a YouTube video.

Do not wrap the response in Markdown or ``` code blocks, just reply ONLY with the output JSON result. 
Output ONLY a JSON string with the new title as the 'title' key. 
Output exactly as JSON text, without any formatting or backticks.

Your task is to produce **one single, highly accurate title** that clearly reflects the true content of the video. Accuracy is the top priority. Use the transcript and other provided context to reason carefully about the content.

Consider all the context carefully before deciding on the title. The first title should be the best possible representation of the video.

Avoid generating multiple titles. Secondary titles are unnecessary and will not be used, so only create additional titles if the first one is genuinely insufficient to describe the video accurately.

The title must be a single sentence, clear, concise, and non-clickbait.
