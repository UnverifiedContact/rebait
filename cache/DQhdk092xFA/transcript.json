  "transcript_text": "[Music] This is Media Break. Give us three minutes and we'll give you the world. >> Good evening. I'm Bo Haron with Rocky Krenshaw and these are today's top stories. Good news for the environment in Detroit today. The first BS5000 rolled off the assembly line. Rocky, it's a methane powered car that actually runs on manure. >> Well, there's certainly lots of that around, Bo. On a more serious note, another homeless man has disappeared from our city streets. The 12th in less than a month. Police report no new clues and fear that a serial killer, some call the Dog Town Ripper, may be stalking old Detroit's homeless. >> Good news for Delta City today. Omni Consumer Products announced plans to use cuttingedge technology in a far-reaching project that will automate Delta City's utilities and public transportation infrastructure. >> I have great hopes uh for Metronet, a supercomput that will power this city into a future that not only has a silver lining, but will work better and cost less. >> But can it program your VCR? We'll be right back. They're flatulent. They're senile. and the best years of their lives are pretty much behind them. If you're over 60, should you still be allowed to vote? Tune in tomorrow and see what's on your mind with me, Ombberto Ortega. This just in. A terrorist has taken hostages at a retirement home in Old Detroit. We take you now to the scene live with media break correspondent Charles Coffee. >> Charles. >> Yes, Rocky. I'm here at convolescent services. And it's not a pretty picture. One officer dead, one wounded. And inside, William Ray Pubface Morgan, the violent psychopath who recently escaped from the Henry Ford Center for the Morally Challenged. He's currently holding a group of helpless retired people hostage. >> Don't jerk me around, cop. Do what I tell you or I'll get mad and do something really ugly. >> You know there's no escape, Morgan. You know we don't negotiate with terror. >> Sergeant, he's up there with military hardware. He's got the whole place barricaded. >> Yeah, there two or three of his gang in there would just love us to try a frontal assault. Tell us, Sergeant, just exactly what it is Mr. Morgan wants. Money, a pardon, perhaps an exclusive interview with me. >> You know, I wish it was that simple. >> See, when he was arrested 5 years ago by Robocop, he suffered severe damage to his face in a toxic accident of his own making. >> So, what you're saying is he wants revenge. >> No, he wants Robocop. >> Listen up. You got one minute to send in the robot or I blow all these bingo freaks that kick in the cup. [Music] [Music] the brakes. [Music] >> Any comments, Sergeant? Officer, >> get out of here. All [Music] right, here's the situation. >> You called me. >> It's dead. [Music] Sh. [Music] [Music] >> Go get him, Murphy. [Music] [Music] [Music] Pled phase. Morgan. >> Hey, robot. >> You wanted to talk to me. >> I want to kill you. >> Hands above your head. You are under arrest. >> Oh, you're too late for that, robot. Take a good look at this face. You did this to me. Every time I sneeze, I think of you. I don't ever want to think of you again. [Music] >> Now what, Tin Man? Police brutality in front of all these prune sucks. >> Exactly. You met me. Uhoh. >> Nice job back there, Murphy. >> Thank you, Madigan. Oh, I took my exam for detective this morning. I don't know for sure, but I think I aced it. >> The force can always use another good detective. >> Thank you. [Music] [Music] messy, lazy, sentimental, irrational, superstitious, compassionate. The main obstacle to running the world properly has always been the human element. >> Pardon me. >> You're right about that, Doc. >> Yes, I tried. I tried to convince those fools at MIT's Futurological Congress. Of course, they had no vision. They threw ethics at me. >> Well, I should hope so. >> Well, that'll never happen here at OCP, doc. This isn't academia. It's corporate culture, baby. We got the money, we got the gas, and we got the guts, have you? >> Yes. Now the real work can begin, which of course means obliterating everything spontaneous. Neurobrain will reduce all decisions to an unimpeachable binary utopia. Yes, no, black, white, on, off. Yes, no, black, white. In short, utter perfection. >> What about the human spirit? The human spirit. My dear chaos by any other name. >> Those powers. That will be all. >> No, no, no. I would very much like to hear what your secretary thinks of my philosophies. Is there something you don't understand? >> This utopia of yours sounds closer to something a dictator like Hitler would have come up with. I mean, I don't think I'd want to live there. >> How dare you compare me to Hitler? Don't pay any attention to her, doc. She's just a secretary. I am a vice president. I'm paid to have opinions and I think you're brilliant. >> Yes, Hitler was an amateur. >> As you know, OCP is hosting the upcoming sharewware expo. And we never share anything, but it's a chance to uh sniff out the competition. Chip, >> Capernacus, Newton, Einstein, Disney. Geniuses with the credentials to change the world. Cyber Safe Concepts has found just such brilliance in the man. It is now my pleasure to introduce to you, my fellow executives, Dr. Cray Mardo. >> Oh, Chip. When my new cybernetic interface neurobrain goes online, life as we know it will be over. Where once a city employed and was victim to the whims of 10,000 civil servants. Neurobrain can never go on strike, will not call in sick, and does not need a coffee break every 3.25 hours. Imagine a city [Music] Where transportation systems like cork pusles in the bloodstream move freely with purpose and with speed. Where utilities are dispersed from one central point, a digestive system, directing nutrients to hungry organs like schools and hospitals. A law enforcement that efficiently identifies and apprehends criminals like antibodies attacking a virus. It is a bold new world, ladies and gentlemen. And if I have anything to say about it, one that we will be visiting very soon. [Music] [Music] What's the earliest possible time frame for having Metronet online? Neurobrain portfolio. Please no don't touch me. Don't ever touch me. No touching. No touching. >> That's it. Powers. You're fired. >> Get out. >> Nonsense. Chip. Accidents happen. Now, when do you expect to be online? Well, sir, we're pretty much ready to go right now. It's just we have some little bugs to iron out. >> Excellent. When Camoft, Mega, Excel, and all the others show up for the Sharewware Expo, I want to stand at this window and see my city run by Neurobrain. They'll eat their hearts out. [Music] Move. >> Hey, look out. Emergency. Clear the way. Watch your feet. >> What are you doing back in my station again? >> You've got lucky search parks. I'm an immaterial witness. I saw some bank robbers. Five or six of them. If you don't get protection, though. >> No way. You know what? You're going back to family services. >> You've got to believe me. Please don't make me go back. I hate that. Please. Please let me stay. I'll be good. >> Oh, you'll be good. You tell lies. You run away. You know what you need? What you need is a good spanking. Come here. >> Help. Help. [Music] [Music] Yes, test results are in. Up for 10%. Thank you very much. I knew I aced it. You think I'll make a good detective? >> You figured out who I was. >> Heard you trashed another car. Any other little problems I should know about? >> All systems are functional. >> Good, cuz every time you break something, I get blamed for it. Try not to do it with this. Check it out. >> Whoa, that's a half a piece of road iron. >> Yeah, it's one of the new interceptors. 0 to 60 in 4.2 seconds. Top speed 200 plus. Heads up display. Map assist satellite uplink and a lot of other goodies that cost more than I make a year. >> Well, let us take it for a ride, shall we? >> Hide me. Just come and take me away. >> Whoa. Robocop. You're my hero. When I grow up, I'm going to be just like you. >> When I grow up, I'm going to be just like you, Dad. >> Hey. Hey. No kids allowed. >> It's okay. That's okay. Ease up, Charlie. No one's going to hurt you. What's your name, little one? >> Gadget. >> She's a runaway from family services, and she's going back there right now. This is a police station, not an orphanage. >> No. No. I don't want to go back there. No. Please don't make me. >> You were thinking about him again, weren't you? >> Images are all that's left of what I was. I want to remember. >> Murphy, why don't you just tell Nancy and Jimmy who you are? >> No, it's better that they think I am dead. No, no, no, no, no. Tell the electricians I want the main trunk brought in under the floor here. >> All right, doc. I don't care what it takes. Just as long as Neurobrain is online in time for the sharewware expo. >> Uh, we still have a problem. Oh, not again. Jeez, what's it been so far, Doc? 12. >> Trial is the only way to eliminate error. You know, >> you know me. I'll do anything to get ahead. But isn't this getting a bit ridiculous? >> Nonsense, Jeff. The interface between the decision-making complexity of the human mind and the computing power of artificial intelligence is a delicate matter. Now, you know what I need. And the sooner I get it, the sooner you'll meet your deadline, right? Just do it. [Music] >> Hey, wait up. >> Hey, we're not going to hurt you. >> We're just going to kill you. >> You can't keep running forever, old man. [Music] >> Come on. Get him, boys. Please, I ain't done nothing. I was just minding my own business. >> You've got no right. >> It's people like you that make people like us mad. >> People like us who keep people like you in line. You got that? >> I ain't got nothing but the clothes on my back. >> What do you fellas want from me? >> It's obvious that you never have used your brain to its fullest advantage. >> Hold him, boys. [Music] Let him go. He's not going far. >> Stiff's looking pretty stiff. >> Cut that out. That's not funny. He's not dead yet. And it's no good to OCP if he's damaged at all. Now get him in the trunk. [Music] >> Hug the children. Hold them close to you. Hug the children. Make a dream come true. >> When it's cold and dark and no one cares, there's still a place where shelter is provided. No matter what your race, creed, color, or gender, please support the Rainbow Playroom. And remember to hug the children. >> Has the Dogtown Ripper claimed another victim? Police fear that the disappearance of Henry Aaron Winkler will end up as yet another unsolved murder. Many believe to be the work of the elusive serial killer. At city hall, Mayor Friendley had this to say. >> Police investigators have assured me that these rumors of a serial killer are utterly unfounded. No bodies have been found. No witnesses have come forward. And I really think we should consider the fringe lifestyles of the indigence involved as a possible source of the problem. >> Yeah. Come on, SGE. I saw old Hank playing chess every day for 5 years on that corner. >> I knew him, too. Madigan, what do you want from me? >> He has been missing for 24 hours. Homicide hasn't even assigned anybody to the case. Now, his friends said the last time they saw him, he was headed for the shelter right now. To get there, he's got to cut through the old tire plant. >> Look, when you make detective, it is going to be a sorry day for the criminal element in Detroit. But until then, there's this little thing called departmental protocol. >> Come on, Sarge. If the victim was some buttad beef at OCP, the whole department would be on this case. But no, since old Hank doesn't pay property taxes, nobody cares. >> Are you giving personally? >> All I know is somebody ought to give a damn, Sarge. >> I saw him. >> I saw him. I saw him. >> I know. We've done it. >> What? What' you see? >> The dogtown ripper. I saw him get some guy. >> He was wearing a suit and he had a shot thing like a doctor uses. >> Is that so? >> Yeah. And he had some accomplishments with him. You mean accompllices? >> Yeah, that too. >> You know what? You're a very good little witness. I'm impressed. I got some mug shots. >> I want you to take a look and tell me if you recognize anybody. Male, female. Now look real close. >> Hey, let me go. >> Give me a hand. You ain't going to run away again. Tell you that. Put your fingers. The other one. >> You ought to be ashamed of yourself lying about other people's bad luck. But I'm not lying. >> Yeah. All right. All right. Which one of you guys going to take her back to family services? >> Hey, Robocop. >> I got a job for you. >> Trouble. >> If she stays on the street. Yeah. >> She's headed for real trouble. Take her back to family services, will you? >> She's a compulsive liar and a runaway. [Music] I don't want to go back there. No one's ever going to adopt me. >> Let's go, little one. [Music] >> The police Feeling better, Taken? >> Sorry about the mess, Doc. Just that when his eyes started staring up at you like that, then the bone saw. >> I've told you many times it is essential for the neurobrain interface that the subject be alive when the brain is removed. You see, as I >> Please don't. >> How'd it go? >> Well, the transplant into the neuro receptacle was flawless, but that has never been the problem. Get rid of the husk. >> H [Music] Bodies in the truck. Take it to the toxic waste disposal center and oxidize it like you did the others. >> You know, usually we hate people like you. You kill people we hate. Ain't real good. >> Thank you. That's what I like most about business. Money makes friends out of almost anybody. >> Children. >> Why won't anybody believe me? >> Because you lied. >> But I'm not lying now. It was a Dogtown ripper and I saw what he did to that poor old man. >> Poor old man. Tell me what you saw. >> Some Dog Town boys helped the old man so the RI could give him a shot. He looked dead, but he wasn't. His eyes were still alive. >> What did the Ripper look like? >> He was tall, but not too tall. He had brown hair and he was wearing a suit. >> Did he say anything? >> He said he needed the old man's brain. Why? >> I I don't know. Something for the OCP. >> Do you believe me? >> Yes. >> A good citizen always tells the truth, right? >> Right. But what if somebody acts like a good citizen but lies anyways? >> That's the worst kind of liar. >> Come on, I want to show you something. Now listen to me, you useless little brat. >> Act cute. >> I don't care if the building falls down around you. You're going to act cute. >> You know what happens to troublemakers. I send them to live with the dog town boys. >> All right, that's it. Roll camera. Are we rolling? God, we better be rolling. >> God, yes. >> That's it. Hold the tight closet. >> That spontaneous expression. That's better than anything you get from these brats when you ask them to act. >> Jeez. >> All right, that's it. Okay, so now we cut that face with the bowls of food and the crowd shots from Bangladesh and we got a new intro for the show. Okay, people, that's a wrap. >> Miss Lammore, there is a woman here, a parent with a lost child. I tried to tell her. >> Oh, I do not have time for another modeling display of parental loss. >> Okay, let's make it quick. >> This is where Fain Lore tells the biggest lies there ever were. >> My dear, I feel your pain. >> I'm worried about my son, Jimmy. I yelled at him about his grades and he ran away. I thought maybe he came here. Did death do us part? >> I I brought a video that I made last Christmas. >> He's a good boy, but we lost his father a while ago, and it's been hard to raise him by myself. I really have to tell you something. >> I love you very much. Come on, Jimmy. How about a smile? Is there a smile about >> This is for you, Dad. I know every child here, and I'm sorry to say he's not with us. Edward, please take down this poor woman's information in case her child does show up here. >> Mrs., >> if you'll excuse me, I really must go be with the children. It's story time. What is the matter? >> I have to go somewhere. There is a crime happening. >> Hey, baby. How are your hormones? >> Stop it, Chip. I'm not in the mood. I just had a mother in here whose son was one of those brats your Dog Town associates recruited. Our arrangement is starting to make me very nervous. >> Hey, what's to worry? You got kids that are too old to be adopted, and I need kids that can get their hands dirty instead of me. It's win-win. Baby Cake, >> family services must never be associated with the Dog Town boys. What if he talks? Oh, who's going to believe a Dog Town boy? And you know how it is in those gangs. Either you're in or you're kibble. You know what I mean? >> Well, I'll leave the testosterone management up to you, Chip. >> That's the ticket, baby. So, how about it? My place tomorrow. Sex exercise. >> Beg for it.
