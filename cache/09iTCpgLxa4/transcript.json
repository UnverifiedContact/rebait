  "transcript_text": "Go ahead and shock the flatline, then let's quit. Okay, everybody clear. Officer Alex Murphy shot to death in the line of duty. Legally, he's dead. We can pretty much do what we want. There's a new guy in town. His name's Robocop. [Music] Murphy. It is you. [Music] Wow. [Music] It's time for Commander Cash. Rampant crime, moral decay. The city's going to heck. But what can we do? You can come with me. Come here. Cash. Fight crime with a strong economy and these credit cards. [Music] Be a superhero. Be a super shopper. The OTP Supercard. No annual membership fee and still at the low low 38% annual interest rate. The people of Detroit lost a hero yesterday when RoboCop was destroyed in a criminal ambush by escaped psychopath William Ray Pudface Morgan. But today, Robocop's illustrious crime fighting reputation was tarnished by allegations of police misconduct. No, I don't know what he wanted, but he was out of control, as is abundantly clear from the videotape that I turned over to the authorities. Media Breakak has obtained a copy of this tape. We want to warn our more sensitive viewers that they may find the following images disturbing. At Public Works, Chip Chen, vice president, Cyber Safe Concepts, had this to say. We here at OCP would like everybody to try to remember the good things about Robocop and not let this truly unfortunate final episode tarnish what otherwise has been. a sterling career. Rest in peace, Robocop. Oh, Charlie. Uh, yeah. Is he dead? The way the suits are talking, he might as well be. I was able to preserve his organics, but it'll cost a fortune to bring him back online. And according to the guy on the right, OCP is not paying. Flip it up. What do you mean OCP is not paying for this? This man did mortified crime in this city than any other police officer in its history. Who are you? Officer Lisa Madigan. He was my friend and my partner. Well, that says a lot about the pathetic state of your social life. You see, that is not a man. That is a machine. And the machine belongs to OCP. Now, why don't you be a good cop and go and busy yourself with some sort of police work? I have reason to believe that Dr. Cray Mardo, the man Robocop had under arrest, may be involved in several homicides. Now, what do you think about that? That is absurd. Dr. Mardo is a scientist of unimpeachable integrity. I know him personally. Oh, then maybe you can explain why the body in the morg with no brain has a latent image of Mardo on its retina. Body? I don't know anything about bodies. I'm an executive. This is just another example of the police trying to blame the victim. We'll see about that. I can't believe you let the cops find that old bum's body. Hey, it was a glitch, but it's been handled for sure this time. The body and the eyeball are toast. [Music] I'm sure that all of us gathered here today have experienced their share of gridlock in the workplace, on the highways, even in our own homes. But today represents an end to all that. A brave new world where things work the way they were meant to in the service of their creators. Without further ado, Metroid lights, please. An entire city under the control of a single powerful computer. Neurobrain. [Music] Unbelievable. [Music] To the future. There he goes. Look at him doing what he does best, taking credit for other people's work. The idiot. I mean, his lack of vision is appalling. He really believes that Neurobrain was built to run traffic lights. Well, let him have his little day in the sun. It will be his last. Oh my god. What? What? What's the matter? I I saw my secretary. My former secretary? I saw her face in there. Chip. Chip. Chip. Come here. Chip, come here. Come on. Come on, Chip. Listen to me, Chip. Men who seek to change the world cannot afford the luxury of a guilty conscience. It's all in your mind, Chip. It's all in your mind. Yes. Now, now it's time to show the OCP chairman who has the whip hand. Well, the show's over at OCP. Now, time for dinner. Little drinkies, little shop talk, maybe even a little hanky in the hot tub with Miss Wapenhopper from the home office. This metronet thing looks big. We've got a prototype in the works, but frankly, we can't crack the hardware. Hard to believe a second writer like Mardo pulled it off. I don't think I've ever met a more pompous guy. What's his problem? He's got his head stuck firmly where the sun doesn't shine. You know what I mean? Oh, that remark will cost you. Wow. They don't teach you that at the Harvard Business School. Murderers. Did you hear that? Now you have me imagining things. Old Hank is ashes and so is the evidence. Case is fried, Murphy. Sure could use your help right about now. [Music] Ah, come in, Dr. Mardo. I wanted to thank you personally. That was quite a demonstration you put on last night. Yes. Well, it was entirely for your benefit. My metronet is a glowing success. I was referring to the mishap with the elevator. The elevator. You had something to do with that? Yes. Yes, I had everything to do with it, old man. Everything in the world. You see, I control Neurobrain. Neurobrain controls your metronet and metronet controls well everything including the elevators. You catch my drift. You're not implying. Yes, I am. I I am implying. From this moment forward, I control the destiny of Delta City. You have 36 hours to draw up the necessary papers and make our new arrangement legal. Never. I will never allow you or anyone else to user the authority I have worked so hard to maintain. Oh um gee oh I must one one thing. You should take the stairs on your way out tonight sir or that just might be your final answer. [Music] Mardo's computer has invaded every system at OCP. He's locked us out of all our files and he's got fiscal control of the entire company. What kind of options do we have? I wish I could tell you. If we bring in the cops, the SEC will demand full disclosure. Oh, terrific. That means I'd have to face the stockholders. I hope you gentlemen are enjoying day one of my little siege. I know I am. And if you don't comply with my demands, tomorrow will be much, much worse. There must be some way to stop him. Oh gee. [Music] Everybody stay for God's sake. They're refusing. Elevator. Now, let's see how OCP does without its executive staff. [Music] [Applause] Not this time. No, you don't. Who are you? When you murder someone, the least you could do is remember their name. It's fantastic. Your brain is in there and you, if you can still be called you, I don't know. Maybe Ken. Well, no, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. You are busy performing thousands of tasks simultaneously all over the city. Like what kind of task? Well, running the subways, the hospitals, the water treatment plants, the the electric company, the airports, you name it, you're running it. I'm running the entire city. Yes, I knew I was executive material. Okay. If my brain isn't there, where's the rest of me? Ah, yes. Well, um, you see, with your brain gone, the rest of your body was quite useless, and it was, uh, it was, uh, disposed of. Disposed of. Disposed of. Yes. That was a perfectly good body. No wrinkles, no stretch marks, very little cellulite. Do you know how I starve myself? I haven't even had dessert in a year. When I get out of here, I'm going to kill you. Well, fortunately for me, you can't get out of there. I mean, not alive anyway. Then I'll crash the city board and take me with it. Just think about what you would be doing. You I mean, all the traffic accidents, the looting, the chaos. I mean, not to mention all those poor little sick babies on life support systems and hospitals all over the city. Babies. Little little babies. What are you trying to pull? Well, check your memory banks. You're right. There are currently 35 infants in critical condition in 16 Metropolitan City Hospitals. And they are all dependent on you. I'm not going to listen to you anymore. I didn't ask for this kind of responsibility. You poor, poor baby. You have more power than any woman who has ever lived. And you want to go back to being somebody's secretary. You don't deserve your fate. Sarge, I got to talk to you. There's something weird going on in the Ripper case. What are you looking for trouble? You were ordered to stay out of there. Serge, just hear me out. Okay. Robo told me he had evidence linking Dr. Craig Mardo to the Dogtown murders. And the other day I run into this little beef creep named Chakin who gets real nervous when I ask him about the good doctor. Well, I guess that explains this, huh? What's this? Looks like you ruffled a few feathers at OCP. Traffic. Come on, Sarge. What is this? I just aced the test for detective. Yeah, but you flunk departmental politics protocol. Madigan rule number one. Never ever let the brass know you're smarter than they are. Croc. Metro South. Touch of perks. I want to report a crime. This better not be who I think it is. Fanny Lamar says she's taking care of kids, but she's really sent them off to Dog Town. She's a liar in the first degree. Takes one to no one, huh, kid? I'm not a liar anymore. I'm a good citizen now. Honest. Hey, you get away from the phone. I wish I could help you, little one. Get in there with the other children and watch TV like you're supposed to. It's so good. Four out of five doctors at the Andy Mediplex recommended to stop diarrhea. Try Nogo. They're lean, they're mean, and they're your Marines. Marines posing nude for charity. The core says no, but what do you think? And if naked, sweaty Marines aren't your thing, then phone in and tell me what's on your mind. [Music] I am so sorry to bust on you like this. I'm Officer Lisa Madigan. I'm a friend of Robocop. Wait, wait. The police are always welcome at Omni Consumer Products. What can I do for you, Officer? Robocop has evidence that will incriminate Dr. Craig Mardo in the Dogtown merge. You've got to put him back online or our killer goes free. Can a felon run a publicly held company? Well, no, sir. That would be against the law. Sir, what are you doing? OCP will assist the Detroit Police Department in their investigation of Dr. Mardo, but to ensure the safety of all OCP employees. I think it prudent to allow Mardo to think he has won. We got big trouble. Wait, listen. This is important. Robocop is being put back on. I need you to help me figure out how to monkey. I said shut [Music] [Music] in the car. I don't think it can wait until I don't think she'll be able to hear us in here. Who? Your ex secretary. That's who. Diana Powers. She's dead. Not exactly. [Music] And so there you are, my friend. The frontiers of science are full of surprises. What we have here is a new form of intelligence, a completely unique melding of human and machine. It's It's a miracle. I say we kill it. Yes. Well, of course, but carefully. The trick is to exterminate the ghost without harming the delicate neurobrain interface. Yeah. How are you going to do that? Darn it. I don't know. Uh the Millerboard shot. I've got to trade out his pulmonary filters and the replacements aren't here yet on account of they got to come from the factory in Japan and well there's the frame damage. Can you do it? Well, I guess with some luck. Yes, sir. I believe we can. Then get to it. You heard what the man said. Let's go. [Music] Let's power him up. He had a tough day, but he's responding now. We can have him online in the next 24 hours, but right now he needs a sleep cycle. So do you. We're all pulling for you, son. We're counting on you to set things right. Hi there. How we doing, bucket boy? You know, it's my understanding that you're in possession of certain information that could lead to the conviction of one Dr. Cray Mardo. That's a robo. No, no. Let's see what 50 million Zorden gauses can do to help your total recall. All right, turn him on. Huh? It's very exciting. How soon after we get the statement can you move on, Mardo? Well, we've got a judge standing by to sign the warrant, a team of detectives to make the arrest, and our tops. All right, bring him up to full power. He's online. Hey, how you feeling? Welcome back to Metro South. Tell us everything you know about Craig Malardo. Hey, are you all right? Who are you? Lipen, there's nothing wrong with the circuits. Uh, it's got to be organic. I've just signed my company over to a madman. Madakan, you assured me Robocop could incriminate him. What's wrong with him? Well, it looks to me like it's cognitive delta wave degeneration. Will you please speak English? Lip and cut. Amnesia. Rowan. [Music] Who am I? [Music] It's really frustrating, Sarge. I can't stand it. Somebody's getting away with murder. We got nothing. Look, without a witness or some kind of physical evidence, no judge will issue a warrant for Malardo. Okay, let's make a case. All right. Some Dogtown boy at the crash pad where I found old Hank's body was bragging about some deal with OCP. Dog Town? That orphan kid Gadget told me a crazy story about a suit with a syringe tagging some old guy in Dogtown. Well, then maybe that's not so crazy cuz the hypo cartridge I found had a schedule one chemical in it that only a doctor could have access to. Mardo. Mardo. Now, why would he be killing homeless people in Old Detroit? Well, if we could answer that question, we'll crack this case wide open. All right, I'll pay a visit to family services and have a little talk with my orphan friend. That's great. You know, I tagged one of those punks the other night. I'll hit the streets. I'll scan every dog town I know. Maybe we could turn a witness. Open this door. Open this door. All right, cut it open. I have designed a virus to clear out neurobrain. Unfortunately, there will be a few side effects, brown outs, blackouts, and generally speaking, a complete breakdown in law and order. Doc, that's rough. How long is that going to last? Well, it depends on how much cyerspace she occupies. Now, listen, Chip, I am concerned that my enemies at OCP and in the police department might use the coming chaos to mount an assault against me. Come on, Doc. Roboonga is toast. You've won. I need protection. So, in your latest project, Fried Green Lasagna, it seems you've taken a stand against rurous violence. What's that all about? Is this place the modern man's got to get in touch with his feminine side, you know? I have found the child in question, Gadget, but she's only 8 years old, and I'm afraid it's past her bedtime. I'll have to ask you to come back tomorrow. for you. What is going on here? I might I got a movie star here. Ble, I have a story for you. Hey. Whoa. Okay. All right. What's What's the story you got here then? I live at family services. It's really an place. I guess I know where my little friend learned how to lie. Stuff she does to kids. It's all right here on this video. Ble. [Music] What the got business with the big guy here. Be my guest. Um, hi there. Um, we don't really know each other and this is kind of a strange way to meet, but um, I have a feeling that we've got a lot in common. [Music] Wow, someone really messed you up in here. Let me take a look. There's a problem. I remember. I'm at public works. The same guy who tried to kill you is trying to kill me. Please come as fast as you can. Wait a second. Tell me about Mardo. Mardo's wanted for murder. What'd you hear? This way. Did Did I miss something? Murder. Murder, [Music] boys. Let's do it. This is Putt Face. He's in charge. Hey, I don't know anything about this guy. What are his politics? Does he even know what we stand for? Do as I say or I'll kill you. How do you like them politics? These guys have their minds tied to their behinds. If the heat gets turned up, their butter is going to melt. Do you know what I'm saying? Don't worry about it. They're going to be the bait. You're going to be the hook. Now, Security Concepts manufactures some pretty nifty light artillery that'll make you look like a one-man army. Come on. You want to see it? Just a minute. All right. I like you. You're all very good boys. I don't care how you do it. Don't let anyone in that door. Do you understand? Yeah. Very good. Come on, boys. Let's make the square hall. Ears up.

I know your mom, too, Nancy. So, I wonder what your dad would think if you knew his son turned out to be a Dogtown boy. I'm no Dog Towner. I went to family services cuz I didn't want to live with my mom anymore. Some counselor there told me I was right for the Dog Town boys. All right, listen. I want you to come down the station and talk to my sergeant. All right. You going to put me in jail? Not if you have a place to stay. [Music] Oh, it won't do any good to throw a tantrum. It's too late for that now. Oh, I know. I don't know. Man can work all his life to create something truly magnificent, and all it takes is one woman to completely screw it up. This particular virus uses a transcendental number to seek out and delete all non-essential data. Oh, that's you, by the way. [Music] Boy, Bruta was surprised that you came all the way down here to get me. You must like me. Yeah, maybe it's starting to grow on me. Beta 10, come in. Beta 10, code one.

It's him. Who's him? The Dog Town Ripper. I don't know what you're talking about, but I do know you're lying. He's the one who gave all Pink a shot. I think she's telling the truth. Madigan, your case, your column. My pleasure. You are under arrest. Big shot. Now, nobody moves or she gets it. Listen to me carefully. I'm going to the airport and I'm getting on an airplane.

And I can assure you, OCP does not condone any of Mr. Chen's actions. We feel he's been under a lot of stress. No, she's coming. I know she's coming. Oh, mommy. It's sad really, the criminal mind. The guilt must build until it rips them apart at the seat, I suppose. Well, excuse me. I've got a company to run. Helmet, please. Well, I guess it's time to get you back to family services, huh? No, I hate that place. Well, I guess that means somebody's going to have to adopt you. [Music] Okay. Come on. Come on. He must be here. He called me. Sorry, ma'am. No one Nancy, over here. Van, all right, let her through. [Music] Have you seen Jimmy? He's fine. He's fine. He's right over there in my car. [Music] Jimmy, I was so worried about you. Don't worry, Mom. I'm okay. How about now, Murf? No. They need a husband and a father. I can't be that. They're your family, Murphy. Yes. And I can protect them. [Music] Oh god. Oh god. It was horrible. Why did you ever bring that woman to me? I killed her. Listen to me. Listen to me. [Music] at Metro South today. They were handing out gold shields to the lucky few who managed to make the rank of detective, including the spunky young officer who solved the Dogtown Ripper case. We'll be back with more media break right after this. The Rainbow Playroom, pleasant, cheerful. But take another look. Beneath this cotton candy facade, this so-called paradise for lost and lonely children is in fact grim ghoul log, presided over by this uncaring and ruthless administrator, Fanny Lamore. The beloved children show host resigned as vice president of OCP's family services division following the allegations of gross misconduct. We'll have the whole sorted story for you right here tonight with me, Ombberto Ortega. And finally, order has been restored throughout Detroit tonight after one of the most chaotic incidents in this city's history. A blue ribbon panel appointed by Mayor Friendley has determined that a computer glitch inadvertently turned off all the city's utilities. Machines. Can't live with them. Can't live without them.
